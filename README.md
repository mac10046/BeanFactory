# BeanFactory
A lighter version and alternate for Spring context, Mainly for usage in the server-less computing like AWS lambda - so that the cold start can be optimized.

if you only have a few beans and properties to be loaded in your application or cloud function - then this can really help you load faster. This is the main objective of this project and I invite you to contribute your ideas and code.
